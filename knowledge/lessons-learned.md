## L01 — 2026-06-01 — Route-handler redirect leaks internal host behind nginx

**Symptom:** `GET /r/<CODE>` returned `307 Location: https://localhost:3013/ro/try` on prod (etutor.ro) — a browser would follow it to the dead internal address. Caught by live behavioral E2E, not by build/tests.

**Root cause:** `new URL("/ro/try", req.url)` in an App Router route handler. Behind nginx, the backend `Host` header is the upstream address (`localhost:3013`), so `req.url` / `req.nextUrl.origin` reflect the internal origin, not the public one. The vhost did not `proxy_set_header Host $host`.

**Fix:** Build redirect targets from the canonical public origin: `const base = process.env.AUTH_URL || req.nextUrl.origin; new URL(path, base)`. (`AUTH_URL=https://etutor.ro` on prod; falls back to request origin for local dev.) The Set-Cookie was already correct — cookies bind to the host the browser requested, independent of `req.url`.

**Prevention:** Never derive a redirect/absolute URL from `req.url`/`req.nextUrl.origin` in a route handler that runs behind a reverse proxy — use `AUTH_URL` or `x-forwarded-host`. Verify redirects with a live `curl -I` (the Location header), not just a green build.
